# Hi, I'm Sangwook Lee!

I am a Ph.D. student at [Virginia Tech Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu), advised by [Prof. Sang Won Lee](https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/) in the [echolab](https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/). My research explores **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, focusing on **accessibility** and **social computing**.

I investigate how **generative AI**, particularly **LLM-powered chatbots**, can bridge the **information gap** by adapting to diverse cognitive needs. Through this work, I aim to **make advanced technology more inclusive, impactful, and meaningful** in everyday life for people from all walks of life.
