# Hi, I'm Sangwook Lee!

I am a Master's student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and am being advised by [Prof. Insik Shin](http://cps.kaist.ac.kr/~ishin/) as a member of the [CPS Lab](http://cps.kaist.ac.kr/).

My interest lies in **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, focusing on **accessibility** and **social computing**. I design systems that **assist non-technical groups in utilizing modern technology** powered by machine learning models. Recently, I have been exploring LLMs for their capacity to generate natural language explanations and human-like reasoning within these systems.
