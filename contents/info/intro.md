# Hi, I'm Sangwook Lee!

I am a Ph.D. student at [Virginia Tech Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu) and am being advised by [Prof. Sang Won Lee](https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/) as a member of the [Echo Lab](https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/).

My interest lies in **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, focusing on **accessibility** and **social computing**. I research how **LLM-powered chatbots** can be leveraged to help diverse groups of people benefit from technology, contribute to society, and improve their well-being. Through my work, I aim to make advanced technology more accessible and meaningful in people's everyday lives.
