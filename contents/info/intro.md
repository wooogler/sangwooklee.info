# Hi, I'm Sangwook Lee!

I am a Ph.D. student at [Virginia Tech Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu), advised by [Prof. Sang Won Lee](https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/) in the [echolab](https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/). My research explores **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, focusing on **accessibility** and **social computing**.

I study how **LLM-based agentic systems** can bridge **knowledge gaps** in **collaborative environments** by facilitating **context-aware communication** and **organizational learning**. My goal is to design intelligent systems that **empower people to create, share, and utilize knowledge** more effectively across organizational contexts.
