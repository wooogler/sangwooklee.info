# Hi, I'm Sangwook Lee!

I am a Master's student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and am being advised by [Prof. Insik Shin](http://cps.kaist.ac.kr/~ishin/) as a member of the [CPS Lab](http://cps.kaist.ac.kr/).

I'm interested in designing systems that enable end-users to optimize algorithms and devices for their specific environments.
