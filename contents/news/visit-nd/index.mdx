After meeting and talking with Toby Li at CHI2023, I got the opportunity to visit his lab at the University of Notre Dame this summer. He warmly welcomed me and even celebrated my birthday.

I engaged in enthusiastic discussions and collaborated with two Chinese undergraduate interns he introduced, working on implementing TOMAS (Task-Oriented Multimodal Agent System).

While it's not yet complete, I plan to conduct additional user studies back in Korea and write a paper on it.
