During my summer visit to the University of Notre Dame, I visited the University of Toronto. I was lucky to be invited by PhD student SuHyeon Yoo to give a guest talk in her group, Dynamic Graphics Projects (DGP).

I gave a talk titled "Leveraging NLP Models in Practice", which introduced the ModSandbox research I published at CHI2023 and the TOMAS research I was doing during my summer visit.

Thank you very much to all the students and SuHyeon for listening to the talk.
