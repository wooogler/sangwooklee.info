I traveled to Honolulu, Hawaii for CHI2024 as a Photography SV, determined to show what the conference truly feels like. Instead of just taking photos, I recorded footage using a smartphone, action camera, FPV drone, and a 360° camera, capturing the full spirit of CHI. To set the right mood, I used [Suno AI](https://suno.ai/) to generate a custom soundtrack themed around Hawaii and CHI2024.

The video was a hit among fellow Student Volunteers, and I had the honor of showcasing it at the Closing Keynote—a moment I’ll never forget. It’s now featured on the [CHI2024 homepage](https://chi2024.acm.org/), letting anyone get a glimpse of the event’s energy.

Participating as a Student Volunteer gave me the chance to meet incredible people from around the world, exchanging ideas and research in the HCI community. I look forward to finding more ways to share the CHI experience!
